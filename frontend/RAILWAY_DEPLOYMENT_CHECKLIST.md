- [ ] Required tables exist (or migrations ready)

## During Railway Deployment

### ðŸš€ Railway Service Deployment
1. [ ] Create new Railway project
2. [ ] Connect GitHub repository

4. [ ] Add all environment variables:
   - [ ] `DATABASE_URL` = Supabase PostgreSQL URL
   - [ ] `SUPABASE_URL` = Supabase project URL
   - [ ] `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` = Supabase anon key
   - [ ] `NODE_ENV` = production
   - [ ] `FRONTEND_URL` = Railway service URL
   - [ ] `JWT_SECRET` = Strong random string
5. [ ] Wait for successful deployment
6. [ ] Test application access: `https://your-service.up.railway.app`

## Post-Deployment

### âœ… Verification Tests
- [ ] Application loads successfully
- [ ] Backend API responds correctly
- [ ] Database operations function
- [ ] User authentication works (if implemented)
- [ ] All major features operational

## URLs for Access

**Application URL:**
```
https://your-service.up.railway.app
```

**Backend API:**
```

```

## Common Issues & Solutions

- âœ… Ensure `FRONTEND_URL` in Railway exactly matches your service URL
- âœ… URL should use `https://`

### Build Failures
- âœ… Check if all dependencies are in correct package.json sections
- âœ… Verify builds work locally first
- âœ… Check Railway deployment logs for specific errors

### Environment Variables Not Loading
- âœ… Restart deployment after adding variables
- âœ… Verify variable names match exactly (case-sensitive)

### Database Connection Issues
- âœ… Verify `DATABASE_URL` is correct
- âœ… Check Supabase database accessibility
- âœ… Ensure Supabase project is not paused or over limits

### 502 Bad Gateway Errors
- âœ… Check if backend service is starting correctly
- âœ… Verify database connection in deployed environment
- âœ… Check Railway logs for startup errors
- âœ… Ensure nginx configuration is correct
